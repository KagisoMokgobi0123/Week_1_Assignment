This is a simple python arithmetic calculator that uses operators(addition(+),substraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/))

How it works:
-Prompt the user for two input numbers
-Prompt for an operator
-Return an answer
-Print both user input numbers and an operator including an answer.

Note:
-Erros handling is not catered 
-Division by zero will give an error
-Use symbols instead of words for operator question
-Expect float answers for division and multiplication operators
